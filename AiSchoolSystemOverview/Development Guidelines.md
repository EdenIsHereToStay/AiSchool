## 2. Development Guidelines

### Purpose
To ensure consistency in coding practices, version control, and deployment procedures across the AI-driven educational system development lifecycle.

### Introduction
This section outlines the guidelines and best practices for development, version control, and deployment that contributors must follow to maintain code quality, facilitate collaboration, and ensure efficient delivery of updates and features.

### Coding Standards and Conventions

#### Overview
Detail the coding standards and conventions to be followed to ensure readability, maintainability, and consistency across the codebase.

#### Specific Guidelines
- **Language-Specific Conventions**: Outline conventions for each programming language used in the project (e.g., Python, JavaScript).
- **Code Formatting**: Specify code formatting rules (e.g., indentation, comments, naming conventions).
- **Best Practices**: Highlight best practices for coding (e.g., error handling, security practices).

### Version Control Workflows and Branch Management

#### Overview
Describe the version control system in use (e.g., Git) and the workflow model adopted (e.g., feature branching, GitFlow, Forking).

#### Branch Management Strategies
- **Branch Naming Conventions**: Define naming conventions for branches (e.g., feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/).
- **Pull Request (PR) Guidelines**: Outline the process for reviewing and merging PRs, including coding review standards and merge criteria.
- **Release Management**: Describe the process for creating releases, including tagging and versioning conventions.

### Deployment Processes

#### Overview
Provide an overview of the deployment processes, including the tools and platforms used for CI/CD.

#### Continuous Integration (CI)
- **Integration Practices**: Describe how code is integrated (e.g., automated builds, unit tests, integration tests).
- **CI Tools**: List the tools used for continuous integration (e.g., Jenkins, Travis CI, GitHub Actions).

#### Continuous Deployment (CD)
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Outline the steps in the deployment pipeline (e.g., build, test, deploy stages).
- **Environment Management**: Describe the strategy for managing different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

#### Rollback Strategies
- **Error Handling**: Explain the procedures for handling deployment failures.
- **Rollback Procedures**: Detail the steps for rolling back a deployment if necessary.

### Conclusion
Summarize the importance of adhering to these development guidelines to ensure the project's success and encourage developers to commit to these practices.
